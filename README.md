The MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that generates a 128-bit hash value. While it was originally intended for cryptographic use, MD5 is now considered insecure due to numerous vulnerabilities discovered over time.

## About
This is a simple Python script designed to decrypt MD5 hashes by using a wordlist for brute-force attacks.

## USAGE:
To run the script, use the following command:

```
python decryptmd5.py <md5hash> <wordlistpath>
```

**Example:**

```
python decryptmd5.py ab334feeb31c05124cb73fa12571c2f6 /home/wordlist.txt
```

```
python decryptmd5.py ab334feeb31c05124cb73fa12571c2f6 D:\\myfiles\\wordlist.txt
```

Feel free to experiment with different wordlists to improve success.
